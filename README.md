Pulling to Keep up-to-date with Changes
When working as a team on a project, it is important that everyone stays up to date.

Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local copy.

With Git, you can do that with pull.

pull is a combination of 2 different commands:

fetch
merge
