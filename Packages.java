/**
 * Built-in Packages
 * <p>
 * The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included
 * in the Java Development Environment.
 * <p>
 * The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more. The
 * complete list can be found at Oracles website: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/.
 * <p>
 * The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class
 * (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all the classes that
 * belong to the specified package.
 * <p>
 * To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword:

     * Java Packages & API
     * <p>
     * A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file
     * directory.
     * <p>
     * We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write  better maintainable code.
     * <p>
     * Packages are divided into two categories: Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
     * User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
