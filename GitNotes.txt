Working with Git Branches
In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.

Let's say you have a large project, and you need to update the design on it.

How would that work without and with Git:

Without Git:

Make copies of all the relevant files to avoid impacting the live version
Start working with the design and find that code depend on code in other
files, that also need to be changed!

Make copies of the dependant files as well.
Making sure that every file dependency references the correct file name

EMERGENCY!

There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
Save all your files, making a note of the names of the copies you were working on
Work on the unrelated error and update the code to fix it
Go back to the design, and finish the work there
Copy the code or rename the files, so the updated design is on the live version
(2 weeks later, you realize that the unrelated error was not fixed in the new design
version because you copied the files before the fix)

With Git:

With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly without impacting the main branch

EMERGENCY!
There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch
You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there
Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the small error fix
that you were missing)
Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.

You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.

Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!

We can see the new branch with the name "git-test", but the * beside master
specifies that we are currently on that branch.

checkout is the command used to check out a branch.
Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the command:
