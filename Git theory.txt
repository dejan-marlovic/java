Working using the GitHub Flow
we learn how to get the best out of working with GitHub.

The GitHub flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub.

It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly.

The GitHub flow works like this:

Create a new Branch
Make changes and add Commits
Open a Pull Request
Review
Deploy
Merge

This  focuses on understanding how the flow makes it easy for you to work together.
